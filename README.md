# Lane-Keeping-Assist-System-using-LQR-Kalman-Filter-MATLAB-Simulink-
This was part of my master's program for Electronic Engineering for Intelligent Vehicles in MUNER. The is part of my Automatic Controls project where I referred published paper know as "A Comprehensive Analysis of Model Predictive Control for Lane Keeping Assist System". I used the model in this as plant for my control system.
# Overview
- Linearized lateral vehicle dynamics
- LQR controller with integral action
- Kalman state observer
- MATLAB/Simulink simulations

## Tools & Technologies
- MATLAB / Simulink
- Control System Toolbox
- State-space modeling

  ## Results
- Zero steady-state lateral error
- Stable yaw-rate and lateral velocity response
