This was part of my master's program for Electronic Engineering for Intelligent Vehicles in MUNER. The is part of my Automatic Controls project where I referred published paper know as "A Comprehensive Analysis of Model Predictive Control for Lane Keeping Assist System". I used the model in this as plant for my control system.
